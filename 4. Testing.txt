# 4. Testing
------------

* Choosing your testing regimen
-------------------------------

* Common Options
----------------
. Test-driven development

. Manual testing


* Final Thoughts
----------------
Whichever testing regime you choose, it's important to get in the mindset of thinking about testing as a sprint priority - not as something to leave and do all at once during the final
phase of development before release.

* Handling leapfrogging bugs
----------------------------
		REMEMBER THAT THE RULES OF AGILE ARE DESIGNED TO KEEP SPRINT TASKS LOCKED IN ONCE THE SPRINT STARTS

		
* Solutions
-----------
. Record and track bugs according to the version or sprint

. Address bugs early instead of waiting for a a big QA session at the tail end of a project

. Consider inserting sprints focused on bug/change requests between the development sprints

. Invest in a good product owner
